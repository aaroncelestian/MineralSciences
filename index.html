                        I am a researcher focused on the ways minerals interact with their environments and living systems, 
                        and how these interactions can be harnessed to address global challenges such as climate change, 
                        pollution, and disease. My work lies at the intersection of science, art, and culture, with a 
                        particular interest in rethinking how we relate to and understand our planet.

                        As Curator of Mineral Sciences at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, I employ 
                        advanced analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution 
                        imaging to investigate mineral-environment interactions. My research spans from searching for 
                        biosignatures in salt crystals to developing sustainable lithium extraction methods.

                <p class="project-meta">Collaboration: UCLA PERL Group, USC | Funding: NASA</p>
                <p>
                    Planetary exploration of Mars and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn have the potential to harbor life. 
                    My research focuses on finding and characterizing biological signatures in minerals such as halite and 
                    epsomite (among other common salts) to explore ways of finding life on other planets. On Earth, hypersaline 
                    bacteria are trapped in fluid inclusions of salt crystals as they grow and can be preserved through deep time. 
                    By investigating how to best analyze these minerals and identify bacteria without opening their crystal tomb, 
                    we can determine the bacteria-mineral relationship that allows these creatures to persist for millions of years.

                <h3>Sustainable Lithium Extraction from Brines</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Funding: Department of Energy | Status: Ongoing</p>
                <p>
                    Lithium is a promising metal with many applications in the energy industry. However, its extraction is not 
                    without environmental problems. The Department of Energy funds me to help develop and characterize new ways 
                    of extracting lithium from brine water at geothermal power plants, wastewater at oil field sites, and 
                    potentially water from the ocean during desalination. The lithium removal is simple and doesn't require any 
                    input to work, making it a low-energy/low-cost solution to global lithium demand and environmental security. 
                    Lithium manganese oxide (LMO) has great potential to provide economically viable Li extraction from a variety 
                    of natural brines with adequate capacity, selectivity, and loading/unloading kinetics.

                <p class="project-meta">Collaborations: La Brea Tar Pits, Prospering Backyards Project</p>
                <p>
                    My research explores processes that use minerals to remove harmful substances from the environment. At the 
                    La Brea Tar Pits, I'm developing ways to use minerals that take energy from the Sun to break down asphalt 
                    into light organic compounds that can be used to make carbon fiber—a near-carbon-neutral process. Through 
                    the Prospering Backyards Pacific Standard Time Art Exhibit, I collaborate with community scientists, artists, 
                    and scientists to research how minerals could be used for reducing lead exposure in contaminated backyards. 
                    These same minerals can also absorb rare earth elements from waste streams and from the human body (e.g., 
                    gadolinium used for MRI contrast).

                <h3>Kidney Stone Formation & Disease</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Status: Ongoing</p>
                <p>
                    Understanding the microbiological factors contributing to calcium kidney stone formation is vital for prevention. 
                    While it is well known that urease-producing bacteria contribute to struvite stone growth, it is less clear how 
                    bacteria may contribute to the development of other types of stones. Bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa 
                    have been detected in patient-derived calcium oxalate stones even in the absence of infection. Our study aims to 
                    elucidate the impact of bacteria on calcium oxalate stone formation through high-resolution imaging of de novo 
                    calcium oxalate crystals in the presence of bacteria.

                <h3>Art & Cultural Heritage: Getty Museum Cabinet Analysis</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Collaboration: Getty Museum</p>
                <p>
                    The Getty Museum recently acquired the Borghese-Windsor Cabinet, a piece of furniture extensively decorated 
                    with agate, lapis lazuli, and other stones built around 1620 for Camillo Borghese (later Pope Paul V). 
                    A primary research goal was to determine if the agates in the cabinet are of a single origin or have more than 
                    one geologic provenance. It was traditionally thought that all agate gemstones acquired during the sixteenth and 
                    seventeenth centuries were sourced from the Nahe River Valley near Idar-Oberstein, Germany. Using near-infrared 
                    imaging to map molecular water inside the agate gems, we discovered that the gems were sourced from different 
                    mines, revealing secrets about Renaissance-era gem trade routes.
